         I would like to make a website that is similar to one of my favorite websites called dbz space. 
         Dbz space is a website that shows the new content coming to a mobile game I like to play on my phone
         before it is released into the game. I would like to make a website similar to it that shows content that will be released 
         in a idfferent mobile game before it comes out.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <ol>
      <li> I would like to make my website a reliable site for gamers to play a specific game that my website is about.</li>
      <li>I want to make my website big.</li>
      <li>I want to make money off my website so I can have another side income </li>         
            </ol>

      <ul>
        <li> The website I would like to model is called Dbz Space. I chose this website because it is a reliable website for gamers. 
            It shows gamers the new content coming to a game they like to play before the developers release it into the game. 
            There isnt many websites like dbz space so I thought it would be nice to make a website for a different game with with a similar look/feel to it.
            Also a easy navigation as dbz space. Link to website <a href="https://legends.dbz.space/">Dbz Space</a></li>
        </ul>
        
         <ol>
             <li>
                 My target audience for my website are mobile game gamers that want 
                 to see the new content coming to their favorite mobile game asap before its release.
             </li>
